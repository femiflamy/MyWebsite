                                  From a little age, I have been extremely interested in computer systems.
    This covered a wide range from applications to games. I was always curious to know how interfaces work and theories
    behind it. Over the years I have pursued my dream of becoming an IT Specialist by attaining a Bachelor’s Degree in
    Computer Science, completing a certificate program in Project Management and IT and amassing over 7 years’ experience
     in IT industry.</p>
